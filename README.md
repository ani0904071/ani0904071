- 👋 Hi, I’m Animesh Kar. I am currently enrolled at the prestigious University of Saskatchewan in a graduate program in Cybersecurity(thesis).
- I completed my graduation in Computer Science (CS) from Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), Bangladesh. 
I started my career in April 2015 Professionally in the Software Industry in Bangladesh. Though I had worked part-time previously and worked on my final year thesis on Image Processing in parallel.
- 🌱 I am currently focused on my master's program. (and sometimes on some online courses in LinkedIn)
  - Currently, working on Android Data Leaks, Information Stealing procedures (for thesis)
  - Went through a project called 'Web Server Fingerprinting': 
    - different VM configuration setup with servers, focusing on service, application, redirection, application levels, & response header analysis with Machine Learning, adaptive HTTP request selections, etc.
  - initially went through code cloning
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, Databases(MySql, SQLite anything), & Web/Mobile Apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any complex Technical Business Logic.
